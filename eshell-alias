Some ppl suggest this:
# echo "alias ll='ls -l'" >> /etc/bash.bashrc

but I like have a file dedicated to alias so: echo "alias ls="ls -a" >>
/etc/bash_aliases but now on second thought, 2 reasons not to do it this way
first, if I put it in my bashrc file I'll be forced to look at that if I want to
browse through my aliases, and second, remembering the plural form of aliases
gives me pause, and any pause on spelling is time away from being productive!
Booo spelling! Also, I just checked by default Ubu sys and since there isn't one
to begin with, eh, why shake the boat.

something else to consider: If your user's $HOME/.bashrc contains the usual

if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then . /etc/bashrc fi Then put it in /etc/bashrc. If it
        doesn't then put it in /etc/profile from where it will at least be read
        for login shells Also, since we're on the topic of alias, something like
        an alias is keybindings and here is some helpful info: You could map it
        to a key, for instance F3, in .vimrc inoremap <F3> <Esc>GA For me, b/c
        you can c-shift-c/v in vi via the terminal I'm going to set that here.

I like this file, and since I have so many aliases I've changed my mind yet again and went with bash_alias
